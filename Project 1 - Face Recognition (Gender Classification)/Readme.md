# Face Recognition (Gender Classification)

The aim of this project is to classify gender male or female, based on facial photos that have been provided. <br>
We need to create deep learning model, so the model can predict the photos, whether the photos is male or female. <br>

The origin of the dataset is from this link https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html, but due to the large size, we just use some of it, <br>
and it has been combined in "Images" folder, we use around 5000 images that consist of male and female images. <br>

The file "list_attribute.csv" is list of all images from the origin dataset, that consist of some columns, and we only need column 'male'.
